Python is one of the easiest programming languages, which makes it great for beginners. By the end of this course, you'll be able to write you're own functioning Python programs. Python can be used for many things, such as web development, data analysis, AI, automation, and games. You'll even be able to run your programs on Windows, macOS, or Linux as Python works on all platforms.

You'll need to setup your own programming environment, which will be explained next.
